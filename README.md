2013-2014 year. All robot code will be in this repository and is a learning tool for our new coders and other programmers.

This is for Tetrix/quad-onmiwheel. 3 motor controllers and 1 servo controller so far. 4 omniwheels will be driven on the base. One motor for arm and the last for crank/flag interface.
